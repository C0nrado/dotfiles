# General purpose config files
## My personal dotfiles

* This repository is meant to be located (cloned) in your basic `~/Documents` directory.

* Script `make_symlinks.sh` will place conf files for all possible applications.

      source ~/Documents/dotfiles/scripts/make_symlinks.sh

* For `bash-git-prompt` ([link](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt)) to work, type in terminal:


      git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt ~/Documents/dotfiles/codes/bash-git-prompt
